# Mod for Laravel 6-9
- Changed Manager variable $app => $container for new [format](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/upgrade#manager-app-property)
- Rename 'image' to 'folkloreimage' - for using with no conflicts with [Intervention](http://image.intervention.io) (config not renamed)

# Laravel Image
Laravel Image is an image manipulation package for Laravel 4 and 5 based on the [PHP Imagine library](https://github.com/avalanche123/Imagine). It is inspired by [Croppa](https://github.com/BKWLD/croppa) as it can use specially formatted urls to do the manipulations. It supports basic image manipulations such as resize, crop, rotation and flip. It also supports effects such as negative, grayscale, gamma, colorize and blur. You can also define custom filters for greater flexibility.

[![Total Downloads](https://poser.pugx.org/folklore/image/downloads.svg)](https://packagist.org/packages/folklore/image)

The main difference between this package and other image manipulation libraries is that you can use parameters directly in the url to manipulate the image. A manipulated version of the image is then saved in the same path as the original image, **creating a static version of the file and bypassing PHP for all future requests**.

For example, if you have an image at this URL:

    /uploads/photo.jpg

To create a 300x300 version of this image in black and white, you use the URL:

    /uploads/photo-image(300x300-crop-grayscale).jpg
    
To help you generate the URL to an image, you can use the `FolkloreImage::url()` method

```php
FolkloreImage::url('/uploads/photo.jpg',300,300,array('crop','grayscale'));
```

or

```html
<img src="<?=FolkloreImage::url('/uploads/photo.jpg',300,300,array('crop','grayscale'))?>" />
```

Alternatively, you can programmatically manipulate images using the `FolkloreImage::make()` method. It supports all the same options as the `FolkloreImage::url()` method.

```php
FolkloreImage::make('/uploads/photo.jpg',array(
	'width' => 300,
	'height' => 300,
	'grayscale' => true
))->save('/path/to/the/thumbnail.jpg');
```

or use directly the Imagine library

```php
$thumbnail = FolkloreImage::open('/uploads/photo.jpg')
			->thumbnail(new Imagine\Image\Box(300,300));

$thumbnail->effects()->grayscale();
	
$thumbnail->save('/path/to/the/thumbnail.jpg');
```
